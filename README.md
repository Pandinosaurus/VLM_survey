# Abstract

Most visual recognition studies rely heavily on crowd-labelled data in deep neural networks (DNNs) training, and they usually train a DNN for each single visual recognition task, leading to a laborious and time-consuming visual recognition paradigm. To address the two challenges, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have been intensively investigated recently, which learns rich vision-language correlation from web-scale image-text pairs that are almost infinitely available on the Internet and enables zero-shot predictions on various visual recognition tasks with a single VLM. This paper provides a systematic review of visual language models for various visual recognition tasks, including: (1) the background that introduces the development of visual recognition paradigms; (2) the foundations of VLM that summarize the widely-adopted network architectures, pre-training objectives, and downstream tasks; (3) the widely adopted datasets in VLM pre-training and evaluations; (4) the review and categorization of existing VLM pre-training methods, VLM transfer learning methods, and VLM knowledge distillation methods; (5) the benchmarking, analysis and discussion of the reviewed methods; (6) several research challenges and potential research directions that could be pursued in the future VLM studies for visual recognition.
